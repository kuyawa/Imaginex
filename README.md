#Imaginex

**Imaginex** is an image browser for the desktop developed in Swift. Select your favorite galleries from imgur.com and download all the images from the web to your desktop for better consumption. You can then zoom in or out, explore the gallery folder or set an image as a wallpaper for your desktop.

Here is a screenshot of the application:

It comes predefined with four galleries like Latest, Funny, EarthPorn and Space, but you can add or remove as many galleries as you want.
